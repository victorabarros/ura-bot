# The journey to develop a twitter bot to publish uranium market'¬†stocks

## The Inspiration

No, I'm not unemployed, I just tried to learn about the uranium market in a funny way. And it became my main pet project.

In late 2021, I found myself at an interesting crossroads in my development journey. I wanted to dive deeper into TypeScript while simultaneously exploring a fascinating investment thesis that was gaining traction: the uranium renaissance. The convergence of these two interests led to the creation of UraBot - a social media bot that tracks and shares uranium stock market data with AI-powered commentary.

The uranium investment thesis intrigued me because it represented a perfect storm of factors: increasing global energy demands, the push for clean energy solutions, and the geopolitical dynamics affecting nuclear power. As someone who loves learning through building, I saw an opportunity to create something that would not only help me understand this market better but also provide value to others interested in uranium investments.

## What is UraBot?

UraBot is an automated social media bot that monitors uranium-related stocks and shares real-time market data, news, and AI-generated analysis across multiple platforms. Currently active on both Twitter/X and Nostr, it tracks major uranium companies and ETFs.

## Technical Architecture

### The Tech Stack

Built entirely in TypeScript, UraBot leverages modern web technologies and APIs:

- Backend: Express.js with TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
- Data Source: Finnhub API for real-time stock quotes and market news
- AI Integration: Replicate AI (Meta's Llama 3.1-405B) for intelligent commentary
- Social Platforms: Twitter API v2 and Nostr protocol for decentralized social media
- Deployment: Railway for hosting with automated deployments
- Scheduling: [cron-job.org](https://cron-job.org/en/) for triggering automated posts (up to 60x/hour, absolutely free)
- Monitoring: Uptime Kuma for health checks and Telegram notifications

## The Learning Journey

When I started UraBot, I had no idea it would become such a transformative learning experience. What began as a simple project to practice TypeScript quickly evolved into a comprehensive exploration of modern web development, API integration, and the fascinating world of uranium investments. The beauty of this project was that it never felt like work - I was genuinely excited to wake up each morning and see what new insights the bot would uncover about the uranium market.

My journey with TypeScript started with skepticism. Coming from a JavaScript background, I wondered if the additional complexity was worth it. UraBot proved to be the perfect vehicle to answer that question definitively. As the project grew in complexity, TypeScript's type system became my safety net, catching potential errors before they could cause issues in production. The moment I realized I could refactor large portions of the codebase with confidence, knowing the compiler would catch any breaking changes, was when I truly understood the power of type safety.

Nothing prepares you for the chaos of real-world API integration quite like building a production system that depends on multiple external services. UraBot taught me that APIs are living, breathing entities that can change, fail, or behave unexpectedly at any moment. This forced me to think beyond just making API calls - I had to design a system that could gracefully handle failures, retry intelligently, and provide meaningful feedback when things went wrong. The satisfaction of seeing UraBot continue to function even when individual services were having issues was incredibly rewarding.

Perhaps the most surprising aspect was discovering how much I enjoyed building and nurturing an online community. Watching the bot interact with real people on Twitter and Nostr was fascinating - I began to understand what content resonated with the uranium investment community and the delicate balance between automation and authenticity. The project also introduced me to the broader ecosystem of social media automation tools, from cron-job.org's free scheduling service to the decentralized Nostr protocol.

What makes UraBot special isn't just the technical skills I developed, but the way it reinforced a fundamental truth about professional development: the best learning happens when you're genuinely excited about what you're building. When you're passionate about the problem you're solving, you're willing to dive deeper, work longer hours, and push through challenges that might otherwise seem insurmountable.

This project taught me that combining technical learning with domain expertise creates a powerful multiplier effect. By understanding both the implementation details and the broader context of uranium investments, I was able to make better architectural decisions and create features that truly served the community's needs. The most rewarding aspect has been watching UraBot grow from a simple script to a production system that serves real users, reminding me that the best projects are those that solve real problems for real people.

## Conclusion

UraBot has been running successfully for over a year, with regular updates and improvements.
UraBot represents more than just a social media bot - it's a testament to the power of learning through building. By combining my interest in TypeScript development with curiosity about uranium investments, I created a tool that serves both educational and practical purposes.

The project has taught me that the best learning happens when you're solving real problems with real technologies. Whether you're interested in TypeScript, financial markets, AI integration, or social media automation, I encourage you to find your own intersection of interests and start building.

The uranium market continues to evolve, and so does UraBot. As the energy transition accelerates and nuclear power gains renewed attention, having tools to track and understand these markets becomes increasingly valuable.
